# sms_spam_detector
Detects if a SMS might be spam or not spam. For the ML model I tried multiple models - GaussianNB, MultinomialNB and BernoulliNB out of which I got the best results for accuracy and precision from MultinomialNB.  Website link - https://spam-sms-detector-9854e7b6d0ba.herokuapp.com/
